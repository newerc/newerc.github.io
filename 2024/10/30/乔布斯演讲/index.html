I’m honored to be with you today for your  commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be  told, I never graduated from college and this is the closest I’ve ever  gotten to a college graduation.</p>
<p>​    Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
<p>​    The first story is about connecting the dots.</p>
<p>​    I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My  biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided  to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be  adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be  adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife, except that when I popped  out, they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So  my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the  night asking, “We’ve got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want him?” They  said, “Of course.” My biological mother found out later that my mother  had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated  from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She  only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would  go to college.</p>
<p>​    This was the start in my life. And 17 years later, I did go to college, but I naively chose a college that was almost as  expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and no  idea of how college was going to help me figure it out, and here I was,  spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I  decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was  pretty scary at the time, but looking back, it was one of the best  decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me and begin dropping in on the  ones that looked far more interesting.</p>
<p>​    It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I  slept on the floor in friends’ rooms. I returned Coke bottles for the  five-cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the seven miles  across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare  Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by  following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later  on. Let me give you one example.</p>
<p>​    Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best  calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every  poster, every label on every drawer was beautifully hand-calligraphed.  Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I  decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned  about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space  between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that  science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.</p>
<p>​    None of this had even a hope of any practical  application in my life. But ten years later when we were designing the  first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me, and we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would  have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts, and  since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them.</p>
<p>​    If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped  in on that calligraphy class and personals computers might not have the  wonderful typography that they do.</p>
<p>​    Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking  forward when I was in college, but it was very, very clear looking  backwards ten years later. Again, you can’t connect the dots looking  forward. You can only connect them looking backwards, so you have to  trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to  trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever—because  believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the  confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the  well-worn path, and that will make all the difference.</p>
<p>​    My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky. I  found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my  parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard and in ten years, Apple  had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company  with over 4,000 employees. We’d just released our finest creation, the  Macintosh, a year earlier, and I’d just turned 30, and then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew,  we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so, things went well. But then our  visions of the future began to diverge, and eventually we had a falling  out. When we did, our board of directors sided with him, and so at 30, I was out, and very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire  adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn’t know what  to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize  for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure and I even thought about running away from the Valley. But something slowly began to dawn  on me. I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not  changed that one bit. I’d been rejected but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</p>
<p>​    I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting  fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of  being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods in my life. During the next five years I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to  create the world’s first computer-animated feature film, “Toy Story,”  and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.</p>
<p>​    In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT and I  returned to Apple and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the  heart of Apple’s current renaissance, and Lorene and I have a wonderful  family together.</p>
<p>​    I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I  hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful-tasting medicine but I guess  the patient needed it. Sometimes life’s going to hit you in the head  with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that  kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you  love, and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work  is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to  do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep  looking, and don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it, and like any great relationship it just gets better  and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don’t settle.</p>
<p>​    My third story is about death. When I was 17 I read a  quote that went something like “If you live each day as if it was your  last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on  me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror  every morning and asked myself, “If today were the last day of my life,  would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “no” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change  something. Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important  thing I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life,  because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all  fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the  face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that  you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of  thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no  reason not to follow your heart.</p>
<p>​    About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a  scan at 7:30 in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on my  pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me  this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor  advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctors’  code for “prepare to die.” It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next ten years to tell them, in just a few  months. It means to make sure that everything is buttoned up so that it  will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your  goodbyes.</p>
<p>​    I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my  stomach into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few  cells from the tumor. I was sedated but my wife, who was there, told me  that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctor started  crying, because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic  cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and, thankfully, I am fine now.</p>
<p>​    This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I  hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept. No one wants to die, even people who want to go to Heaven don’t want to die to get there, and  yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.  And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single  best invention of life. It’s life’s change agent; it clears out the old  to make way for the new. right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.  Sorry to be so dramatic, but it’s quite true. Your time is limited, so  don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma,  which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let  the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice, and most  important, have the courage to follow heart and intuition. They somehow  already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is  secondary.</p>
<p>​    When I was young, there was an amazing publication called <em>The Whole Earth Catalogue</em>, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a  fellow named Stuart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he  brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s,  before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made  with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. it was sort of like  Google in paperback form 35 years before Google came along. It was  idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stuart and  his team put out several issues of the <em>The Whole Earth Catalogue</em>, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s and I was your age. On the back cover of their final  issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you  might find yourself hitch-hiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath  were the words, “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” It was their farewell  message as they signed off. “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” And I have  always wished that for myself, and now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. Stay hungry, stay foolish.</p>
